Baguio (UK: /ˈbæɡioʊ/ BAG-ee-oh, US: /ˈbɑːɡiˈoʊ/ BAH-ghee-oh, -⁠OH, Tagalog: [ˈbagjɔ]), officially the
City of Baguio (Ibaloi: Siudad ne Bagiw; Ilocano: Siudad ti Baguio; Tagalog: Lungsod ng Baguio), is a 1st
class highly urbanized city in the Cordillera Administrative Region, Philippines. It is known as the
"Summer Capital of the Philippines", owing to its cool climate since the city is located approximately
4,810 feet (1,470 meters) above mean sea level, often cited as 1,540 meters (5,050 feet) in the Luzon
tropical pine forests ecoregion, which also makes it conducive for the growth of mossy plants, orchids
and pine trees, to which it attributes its other moniker as the "City of Pines".[8]

Baguio was established as a hill station by the United States in 1900 at the site of an Ibaloi village known
as Kafagway. It was the United States' only hill station in Asia.[9]

Baguio is classified as a highly urbanized city (HUC). It is geographically located within Benguet, serving
as the provincial capital from 1901 to 1916,[10] but has since been administered independently from
the province following its conversion into a chartered city. The city is the center of business, commerce,
and education in northern Luzon, as well as the seat of government of the Cordillera Administrative
Region.[11] According to the 2020 census, Baguio has a population of 366,358.[4]

Pollution
Smog from vehicles in Bonifacio Street in 2018 Baguio suffers from air pollution and is one of the cities with the dirtiest air in the Philippines, according to a 2014 WHO report;[57] a slight improvement in the city's air quality was cited in 2017 by the DENR's Environmental Management Bureau. In a 2018 WHO report, the city was listed as having the most polluted air among 8 other local cities (Cebu, Dagupan, Davao, Manila, San Carlos, Urdaneta and Zamboanga).[58] Eco-vehicles and Euro 4 compliant vehicles have been tested whether or not they are suited for the city's steep slopes in line with efforts to modernize its Public Utility Vehicles (PUVs).[59] PUVs, specifically jeepneys, have been pushed for its modernization, in line with President Duterte's PUV modernization initiative.[60]

Another problem that plagues Baguio is its garbage and waste disposal. The city has been dumping its
garbage in a landfill in Urdaneta City, but rising costs are putting a strain on the city's budget.[61] In
early 2018, the city government started using its garbage transfer station in the city outskirts near
Marcos Highway, drawing protests from residents of the nearby town of Tuba, who cited the facility
poses health hazards to their communities.[62] As of 2019, the Philippine National Oil Company has
offered to test a waste-to-energy technology as a possible solution to its garbage woes.[63] Baguio's
waste water treatment plant is also eyed for an expansion as it has been unable to fully cater to the
city's needs; wastewater which the plant could not accommodate were dumped in the Balili River,
leading to its high coliform levels—even higher than that of Manila Bay's.[64]

Landscape

Baguio is also a planned city. American Architect and Urban Planner Daniel Burnham was commissioned
to design the new capital; his design for the city was based on the City Beautiful movement,[65] which
features broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles.

During the Second World War, Baguio was razed to the ground during the Japanese forces' invasion and
the subsequent shelling by American forces during the liberation.[66] After the liberation, rebuilding
began and most of the historical buildings were thoroughly reconstructed. However, some of the
historic buildings from the 19th century that had been preserved in reasonably reconstructible form
were nonetheless eradicated or otherwise left to deteriorate.[citation needed] The 1990 Luzon
earthquake further devastated Baguio's old buildings, which include 28 collapsed buildings such as
hotels, factories, government and university buildings, and many private homes and establishments.[67]

Baguio's current landscape is mostly of contemporary architecture.[citation needed]
